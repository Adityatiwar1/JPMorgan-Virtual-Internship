# JPMorgan-Virtual-Internship
### Software Engineering Virtual Experience

#### I request all of you to just take an overview of these files and not to directly copy these files as it is as there is some user specific data in each interns work.

In this repository, would be uploading my patch files (work done).

You can take an overview and a basic understanding of the work to be done.
There are 4 assignments to be done out which only 3 are necessary for the certificate.



The program has practical task modules in:

1. Establishing Financial Data Feeds
2. Frontend Web Development
3. Data Visualization with Perspective



The tasks to be done in the internship:
1. Interface with a stock price data feed
   (Financial Data, Python, Git, Basic Programming)
   
2. Use JPMorgan Chase frameworks and tools
   (React, Typescript, Web Applications)
   
3. Display data visually for traders
   (Technical Communication Financial Analysis Web Applications)
   
4. Bonus task: Open source contribution
   (Contribute to Perspective on GitHub)
   
   
   As mentioned "It takes approximately 5 hours to complete this Virtual Experience",  but I took around a 15 hours.
